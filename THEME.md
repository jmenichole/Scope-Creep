## Status Messages & Emojis

### Positive States
- ✨ **All within scope** - Everything is aligned with the agreement
- 🌿 **Scope aligned** - Project is tracking to original terms
- 🌸 **Terms updated** - Renegotiation successfully completed

### Attention States (No Red!)
- ⚠️ **Pending negotiation** - Client requested scope adjustment
- 💫 **Reviewing request** - Analyzing potential scope change
- ☁️ **Project paused** - Mindful pause while terms are realigned

### Work Assessment
- 📝 **Minor additional work** - Small scope adjustment (< 5 hours)
- 🌿 **Moderate additional work** - Medium scope adjustment (5-10 hours)
- 💫 **Significant additional work** - Large scope adjustment (> 10 hours)

## Severity Levels

Instead of aggressive terminology, we use calming language:

| Old Term | New Term | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Critical | needs-attention | Requires immediate but calm review |
| High | notable | Worth noting and addressing |
| Medium | gentle-reminder | Polite nudge to review |
| Low | awareness | Simple FYI, no action needed |

## Typography Guidelines

- **Headings**: Friendly sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro Display)
- **Body**: Clean, readable sans-serif (e.g., Inter, SF Pro Text)
- **Tone**: Professional but warm, firm but kind

## UI Principles

1. **Soothing Interface**: No harsh red alerts or aggressive warnings
2. **Hidden Strength**: Calm appearance with legal backbone
3. **Emotional Intelligence**: Understanding but boundaried
4. **Professional Kindness**: Nice freelancer energy with contract law precision

## Message Examples
